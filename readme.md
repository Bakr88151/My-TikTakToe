# My TikTakToe:

This project yields a Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring both a front end implemented using the Pygame library and a decision-making backend employing a Breadth-First Search algorithm. Theoretically speaking, beating this game is considered impossible. Thanks to the BFS and MinMax algorithms, it thwarts any potential paths that might lead to the player's victory. If you play optimally or well enough, the game will likely result in a tie. However, take a chance and make a suboptimal move, and you'll find yourself on the losing end. Players are given the option to choose between playing with X or O at the beginning of each game.
